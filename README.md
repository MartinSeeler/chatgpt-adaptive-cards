# ChatGPT Clone

This project is a ChatGPT clone built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React](https://reactjs.org), and [Material-UI](https://mui.com). It aims to replicate the core functionality of ChatGPT while providing a customizable and extendable codebase.

## Features

- Chat interface similar to ChatGPT
- Material-UI components for a sleek, modern UI
- Next.js for server-side rendering and optimal performance
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application code
  - `page.tsx`: The main chat interface
  - `layout.tsx`: The root layout component
  - `globals.css`: Global styles
- `theme.ts`: Material-UI theme configuration

## Customization

You can start customizing the app by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

To change the Material-UI theme, edit the `theme.ts` file.
